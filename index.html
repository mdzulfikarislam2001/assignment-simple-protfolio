                <p>My mission in 2022 is to be a small developer. And I want to succeed in that mission with the help of
                    programming heroes. Now my only purpose is to work with attention.</p>

                <p>I used to have a wing barrier, if I wanted to fly I would go head to head. And now I think I can fly.
                    Because now all I can imagine is just a programming hero.</p>
